# Dev Diary: Useable Autocompletion and Future Proofing

## Autocompletion of "custom" variables

If you are working with `serverless`, you surely have encountered [`serverless variables`].
Especially if we talk about the variable scope `self` in combination with the `custom` object.
Typically this is used as a place for any kind of arbitrary configurations variables used over the whole serverless IAC file.

For example, think about defining parameters that'll use, which you can easily change.
Say the max retention period of a log stream.
Instead of having to navigate includes CloudFormation / Severless IAC files, you open your main `serverless.yml` and change that value.
Really helpful, if you use this variable in many other places as well.

See where this is heading? I wanted to implement autocompletion for variables defined inside the `custom` object.

## Where to start

Since LSP's body is based on [JSON-RPC] it's possible to think of an event driven process.
See following (surely not entirely methodically correct) sequence diagram:

![Sequence diagram for autocompletion](/docs/images/2020-04-21-sequence.jpg)

## Quick Notice: Retrieving File Content

While working with the `textDocument/completion` request it occurred to me, that there is no [`TextDocument`] included in the request body.
Instead it only contains the identifying URI of the document.
However the current version of the document is cached by the usage of the `vscode-language-server` package (this happens on every `textDocument/didChange` request)

```js
import { TextDocuments } from 'vscode-languageserver';
import { TextDocument } from 'vscode-languageserver-textdocument';

const documentManager = new TextDocuments(TextDocument);
documentManager.get(uri);
```

The method `get` is used by my `textDocument/completion` event handler.

## The Serverless Symbol Tree

As seen in the sequence diagram above, there exists a method called `parseSymbolTree`.
The so called symbol tree is a custom data structure, which contains different (meta) information about the `serverless.yml` file.
For this first iteration, it will only contain an array named `symbols`.
Each symbol is defined by a mandatory `label` and a `keyPath`.
The label essentially is the name of the symbol and the key path describes the position of the symbol inside `custom` as string.
It's easier to explain a `symbol` by a example:

```js
// Parsed serverless YML
{
  custom: {
    nested: {
      aKey: 'aValue';
    }
  }
}

// Representing symbol array
[
  {
    label: 'aKey',
    keyPath: 'nested.aKey',
  },
];
```

## Autocomplete custom variables

Using the symbol tree (which parsing process I developed) it was quite easy to implement a first working prototype for the autocompletion.

![Autocompletion for custom variables](/docs/images/2020-04-21-custom_autocomplete.gif)

Quite satisfied I leaned back and thought, what if a user wants to document more information about a symbol.
So I tinkered about the idea to allow inline documentation.
I found out, that the [YAML parser] has a feature to parse comments as well.
So I extended the `symbol` object by a optional `description` field.
After that I was ready to finish my first iteration of an autocompletion feature for my `serverless framework language server`.

## Improvements for the future

There are different improvements I'll want to implement in the future.
For example, if the user already started the serverless variable syntax (`${{...`),
the current implementation will not consider this.
We would end up with a messed up completion, e.g. `${{${{self:custom.messedUp}}`.
Another obvious problem is, that a [custom defined variable syntax] is not used by the current autocompletion feature.
It still isn't perfect, but it is a working first iteration.
